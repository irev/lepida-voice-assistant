python setup_assistant.py

# Quick setup with logging
python setup_assistant.py --quick

# Frontend setup with logging
python setup_assistant.py --frontend

# Recovery mode with logging
python setup_assistant.py --recovery
```

### Log File Analysis
```bash
# View latest setup log
ls -la logs/setup_*.log | tail -1

# Monitor real-time logging (Linux/Mac)
tail -f logs/setup_$(date +%Y%m%d)_*.log

# Search for errors in logs
grep "ERROR" logs/setup_*.log

# Search for specific step
grep "virtual environment" logs/setup_*.log
```

## üìã Log Levels

### INFO Level
- Setup progress and status updates
- System information and configuration
- Successful completion of steps
- Performance metrics

### WARNING Level
- Non-critical issues that don't stop setup
- Missing optional dependencies
- Configuration warnings
- Recovery suggestions

### ERROR Level
- Setup step failures
- Critical system issues
- Installation problems
- Detailed error information with solutions

### CRITICAL Level
- Fatal setup errors
- System incompatibility issues
- Complete setup failures

## üîç Reading Log Files

### Log Entry Format
```
2025-07-25 10:18:09,365 - INFO - Setup started at: 2025-07-25 10:18:09.365252
2025-07-25 10:18:09,384 - INFO - üîÑ STARTING: Checking Python version
2025-07-25 10:18:09,385 - INFO - ‚úÖ SUCCESS: Checking Python version (executed in 0.00s)
```

### Key Log Sections
1. **Setup Header**: System information and session details
2. **Prerequisites Check**: System compatibility validation
3. **Setup Steps**: Individual component installation/configuration
4. **Error Details**: Failure information with recovery guidance
5. **Summary**: Final status and next steps

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting with Logs

### Finding Setup Issues
```bash
# Check for failed steps
grep "‚ùå ERROR\|FAILED" logs/setup_*.log

# View error codes
grep "Error Code:" logs/setup_*.log

# Check execution times
grep "executed in" logs/setup_*.log
```

### Common Log Patterns

#### Successful Setup
```
INFO - ‚úÖ SUCCESS: Step Name (executed in X.XXs)
INFO - Setup completed. Failed steps: 0
```

#### Failed Setup
```
ERROR - ‚ùå ERROR: Step Name - Error description
ERROR - Error Code: ERROR_CODE
INFO - Recovery suggestion: Solution description
```

#### System Issues
```
WARNING - ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Prerequisites - Issue description
INFO - System Information: detailed_info
```

## üîß Log Management

### Automatic Cleanup
The setup system automatically manages log files:
- Creates timestamped logs for each session
- Preserves historical setup attempts
- No automatic deletion (manual cleanup required)

### Manual Cleanup
```bash
# Remove logs older than 7 days (Linux/Mac)
find logs/ -name "setup_*.log" -mtime +7 -delete

# Keep only last 5 setup logs (Linux/Mac)
ls -t logs/setup_*.log | tail -n +6 | xargs rm -f

# Windows cleanup (PowerShell)
Get-ChildItem logs\setup_*.log | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -Skip 5 | Remove-Item
```

## üìà Benefits
